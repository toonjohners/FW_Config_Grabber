###### Fusionworks Config Grabber ########

These scripts will be used to grab the current configuration
set in the Openet Ocli interface.

The commands will run a "show" on each directory and it preceding
subdirectories. It will then send the output to a "configuration"
directory within this folder



File Structure:

- getconfig.sh : This is the file used to grab the configuration
- subdirs.awk  : Used in conjuntion with getconfig.sh to find the subdirectories
- compare.sh   : Use this to compare configuration directories. 
- .profile     : profile of the fusionworks user to be able to connect to ocli 




::Running the getconfig.sh::

1. Update or change the ".profile" file with the current settings. 

2. Edit the getconfig.sh on line 40 and change/update the ocli username/password. 
   for example "Administator/Openet10"

3. Run ./getconfig.sh 
   NOTE: this can take anywhwere from 20min plus, to run through the whole configuration. 

4. A new folder called "config_{hostname}" should now appear in the current directory. 
   This contains a listing of all current configuration of Fusionworks.



::Running compare.sh::
1. run ./compare.sh and you will be asked 2 questions
   Point to the first configuration directory "config_{hostname}"
   point to the second configuration directory "config_{hostname}"

2. If there are differences found a folder called "dd_mm_yyyy.hh.mm" will be created 

3. In this folder will be a file called "List_of_Diffs" which will have a list of all delta's found. 

4. There will also be folders with a coupy of the files and the differences made. 
   These folder(s) will contain 3 seperate files
